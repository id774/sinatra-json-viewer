# Sinatra JSON Viewer

## A simple json data viewer

Preview json data for presentation, etc.


## How do I get started?

    bundle install --path=vendor/gems


## How do I start the application?

Start the app by running:

    bundle exec rake s

This rake command runs `bundle exec shotgun config.ru` behind the scenes for you and starts the app on Sinatra's default port 9393 and will now be able to view the application in your web browser at this URL [http://localhost:9393](http://localhost:9393).

You'll also want to open a new terminal window to the same directory and run `compass watch` to watch the Sass files for changes.
